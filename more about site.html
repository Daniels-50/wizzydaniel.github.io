    <h2>RAINFALL AND WATER DEFICIT OF THE PERMANENT SITE.</h2>
	<p>The mean annual rainfall of Udi is used for the permanent site, which is based on average between Enugu and Nsukka.
	Enugu and Nsukka are within 65 to 70 of rainfall that is about 1,950mm to 2,100mm and water deficit of 41omm. While this amount of rainfall is considered adequate for crop production a feature of the rainfall pattern and its distribution marked by dry season from November t march is a matter of great concern for soil test results. The good news however is that rainfall is evenly distributed at Udi and the permanent sit as observed towards the end of October.
	Weather pattern generally show a little dry season, with the characteristic august break during the rains. 
	The rainfall pattern is with two maxima which is spread at least over eight (8) rainy months.</p>

<h2>SOIL TEST</h2>
<p>A field and laboratory study of Mary Agro farm permanent site at omughu was carried out by Tony Mansfield agro consult Benin City
Samples from ‘4’ different locations were taken to the soil science laboratory of the university of Benin , facility of agriculture as well as the soil chemistry division of the Nigeria institute for oil palm research NIFOF, for routine and critical analysis required for the proposed farm project establishment.
	The soils at the permanent site are generally derived from unconsolidated coarse sand stones interbeded with layers of clay. Typically their clay content increases down the profile as the dominant color becomes brighter when dug further down.
	The soils are fairly deep in some locations.  The hills/uplands at the permanent site have soils and rocky grounds   still undergoing weathering process.
	A profile characteristic study from the four locations showed different soils with similar profiles.
	Some of the soils are deep with good texture, well drained and rich in organic matter and basic soil nutrients judging by its color. Some other soils have clay deposits making them to be water haggled at some point/ period of the rainy season.
	Also, the profile characteristics clearly show and established that there are different soils classified into soil series.
	DEFINING THE TERM SOIL SERIES- a soil series for the purpose of this report is defined as a group of soils with similar profile characteristics developed from the same parent materials.
	Soil series such as sandy loan overlying salty clay loan and salty clay from different depths such as 18 depths were observed in the field.
	In some locations, the upper layer is dark in color and consist of coarse sandy loan with living organisms like earth worms visibly seen. This layer is easily porous with good depth and ladder with organic matter / humus and slightly below this profile is compact sandy loan merging into brownish clay. This is a real cultivable soil with rich fertile profile.
	The basic texture class of soils at the site can therefore be summarized as sandy clay, salty clay and sandy clay loamy.
	According to soil taxonomy of America, and food and agricultural organization F.O.A standards, these soils are productive and good for cultivation.
	However, the rapid percolation of water in some of these soil services will surely accentuate the adverse, effect of a prolonged dry season, therefore required supplementary moisture supply through irrigation.
	From the analysis of the soil chemical properties, it can be seen that acidity is a common feature in the entire sample tested, both at the university soil science laboratory and the chemistry division of NIFOR. The good news here is that it will not pose any hindrance to crop cultivation and growth because the soil are slightly or moderately acidic from 6.0 to 6.5 and slightly less in some soils. For example, Avocado pear, Persia Americana can tolerate and grow well in wide range of soils with a PH of between 5 and 7.
	The ideal soil for most varieties is loose loamy or sandy soil with slightly acidic to neutral PH between “5-7”. These conditions are readily available at the permanent site; hence this crop can be grown in large scale for the export market.
	Find, attached- results of physical and chemical properties of soils tested.
	Also find attached- sol test result after the ground breaking event of the permanent site as a follow up which include fertilizer recommendation for projected crops. Following strictly soil nutrients status, PH and texture of the sol tested.</p>
<h2>GEOLOGICAL REPORT FOR GROUND WATER DEVELOPMENT AT THE PERMANENT SITE.</h2>
	<p>A geophysical/ ideological investigation, where carried out for ground water development at the permanent site by an exploratory firm- Sabatex Drilling service board firm Enugu.
	About seven locations were investigated and results were encouraging backed by the natural water bodies at the site Ajali River, Okpoku water fall and Heneke Lake.
	Electrical resistivity and depth (thicker) alone will not be the major or deciding factor for a good and functional water development. Texture to soil such as coarse shape white sand within the aquifer layer should be a reference factor not only  for quality water, nut for an effective and sustainable flow of water over a long period of time without blockage average water depth from the seven locations is 220m.
